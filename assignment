1. Refactor your POST handler to support inserting bookmarks into the database.
    [] Refactor or implement the integration tests for POSTing 
       bookmarks as well as making sure appropriate responses get sanitized.
    [] You should also test that your POST /bookmarks endpoint 
       validates each bookmark to have the required fields in valid formats. 
       For example, rating should be a number between 1 and 5.
    [] If your POST endpoint responds with the newly created bookmark, 
       make sure that appropriate fields get sanitized.
2. Refactor your DELETE handler to support removing bookmarks from the database.
    [] Refactor or implement the integration tests for DELETEing bookmarks 
       as well as making sure the DELETE responds with a 404 when the bookmark 
       doesn't exist.
3. Refactor your GET methods and tests to ensure that all bookmarks get sanitized.
